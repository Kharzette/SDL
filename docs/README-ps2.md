Credit to
   - The guys that ported SDL to PSP & Vita because I'm taking them as reference.
   - David G. F. for helping me with several issues and tests.

## Building
To build SDL library for the PS2, make sure you have the latest PS2Dev status and run:
```bash
cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk/ps2dev.cmake
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

## Notes
If you trying to debug a SDL app through [ps2client](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2client) you need to avoid the IOP reset, otherwise you will lose the connection with your computer.
So to avoid the reset of the IOP CPU, you need to call to the macro `SDL_PS2_SKIP_IOP_RESET();`.
It could be something similar as:
```c
.....

SDL_PS2_SKIP_IOP_RESET();

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
.....
```
For a release binary is recommendable to reset the IOP always.

Remember to do a clean compilation everytime you enable or disable the `SDL_PS2_SKIP_IOP_RESET` otherwise the change won't be reflected.
